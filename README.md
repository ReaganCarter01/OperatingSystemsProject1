   Description: Reads a list of U.S. abbreviations from stdin and will display it in alphabetical order.Sequence is read until an EOF is encountered.
   How to run: 1) Using the Terminal type in the following command gcc -std=gnu99 -o sort sort.c    (note: make sure you are in the right directory you can do this by using cd %PATHNAME% where %PATHNAME% is the path where the file is located)
               2) Next type ./sort in the terminal
               3) Next type in state abbreviation (ex: TX)

  How to run: 1) Using the Terminal type in the following command gcc -std=gnu99 -o parent parenttochild.c    (note: make sure you are in the right directory you can do this by using cd %PATHNAME% where %PATHNAME% is the path where the file is located)
              2) Next type ./parent in the terminal
              3) Next type in state abbreviation with Population (ex: TX 26)
              4) Press Ctrl-D to print results

  Description: Takes in an Unix command from the command line and fork() a child to execute it. The process id of the parent and the child is printed.
  How to run: 1) Using the Terminal type in the following command gcc -std=gnu99 -o prog Program3.c    (note: make sure you are in the right directory you can do this by using cd %PATHNAME% where %PATHNAME% is the path where the file is located)
