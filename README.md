1A.Program: pre.c

Description: Reads a list of U.S. states and their population and outputs the list if the population is over 10 million. The inputs end when an EOF(generated by Ctrl-D) is encountered.

 How to run: 1) Using the Terminal type in the following command gcc -std=gnu99 -o pre pre.c    (note: make sure you are in the right directory you can do this by using cd      %PATHNAME% where %PATHNAME% is the path where the file is located)
               2) Next type ./pre in the terminal
               3) Next type in state abbreviation with population (ex: TX 26)
               4) Press Ctrl-D to print results

   Description: Reads a list of U.S. abbreviations from stdin and will display it in alphabetical order.Sequence is read until an EOF is encountered.
   How to run: 1) Using the Terminal type in the following command gcc -std=gnu99 -o sort sort.c    (note: make sure you are in the right directory you can do this by using cd %PATHNAME% where %PATHNAME% is the path where the file is located)
               2) Next type ./sort in the terminal
               3) Next type in state abbreviation (ex: TX)
               4) Press Ctrl-D to print results

  Description: The parent performs a "./pre" process and is connected to the Parent-To-Child pipe the child will 'exec' a './sort' process
  How to run: 1) Using the Terminal type in the following command gcc -std=gnu99 -o parent parenttochild.c    (note: make sure you are in the right directory you can do this by using cd %PATHNAME% where %PATHNAME% is the path where the file is located)
              2) Next type ./parent in the terminal
              3) Next type in state abbreviation with Population (ex: TX 26)
              4) Press Ctrl-D to print results



3.Program: Program3.c
  Description: Takes in an Unix command from the command line and fork() a child to execute it. The process id of the parent and the child is printed.
  How to run: 1) Using the Terminal type in the following command gcc -std=gnu99 -o prog Program3.c    (note: make sure you are in the right directory you can do this by using cd %PATHNAME% where %PATHNAME% is the path where the file is located)
